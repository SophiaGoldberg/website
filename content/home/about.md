I work in Theoretical Cosmology, the study of how the universe came to be and evolved to its current state.

I'm working with [Dr Timothy Clifton](http://astro.qmul.ac.uk/directory/t.clifton) and [Dr Karim Malik](http://astro.qmul.ac.uk/directory/k.malik) on the application of a two-parameter perturbation theory to describe structure on cosmological scales at late times - this includes structure like galaxies and clusters. The correct application of General Relativity to Large-Scale Structure (LSS) is increasingly important with increasing observational precision. It is also important when comparing different theories of gravity to observational data.

I also have an interest in complexity science. I worked with [Dr Tim Evans](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.evans) during my master’s and EPSRC funded summer project on accurately modeling citation networks – the network of scientists connected via references to one another. This is motivated by understanding whether 'good' publications gain the most citations.
